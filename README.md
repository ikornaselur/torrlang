# Torrlang

A small project to implement a working torrent client, at least to implement
BEP 3 and possible others.

First project I'm writing in Erlang, mainly to get some experience with writing
a project, while going through the "Programming Erlang" book by Joe Armstrong.

## Running

Not much here right now..

## Tests

Tests are written with the EUnit framework. The `test` make target will run all tests.

## Docs

Documentation can be generated by running the 'docs' make target.
